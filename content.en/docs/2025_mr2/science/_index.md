## Summary

This study details the process of selecting experiments for life detection as part of the Science Mission. Two primary approaches were employed to conduct a total of three experiments for life detection. First, two protein detection experiments were performed using Biuret solution and Bradford solution. Second, UV-Vis spectral scanning was carried out using distilled water as the solvent. Among the four protein detection reactions—Biuret, Ninhydrin, Lowry, and Bradford—the Biuret reaction and Bradford reaction were ultimately chosen, taking into account factors such as the mission time, the fact that the experiment is conducted inside the rover, and the precision required for protein detection.

## Abstract

This study outlines the process of selecting experiments for life detection as part of the Science Mission. Two major approaches were employed for life detection, resulting in the execution of three distinct experiments. These included two protein detection experiments using Biuret solution and Bradford solution, as well as UV-Vis spectral scanning with distilled water as the solvent. Four protein detection reactions — Biuret, Ninhydrin, Lowry, and Bradford — were conducted. Considering factors such as the allocated mission time, the experiment being conducted inside the rover, and the precision required for protein detection, the Biuret reaction and Bradford reaction were selected as the most suitable methods.

# 1. Introduction

## Protein Detection Using a Spectrophotometer

There are two methods to quantitatively measure the protein content in a sample: colorimetric and electrophoresis methods. The origin of protein quantification is the Kjeldahl method, which involves decomposing the sample in sulfuric acid and then measuring the amount of hydrochloric acid remaining after distillation. However, using a spectrophotometer allows for an easier calculation of protein content. This method employs a reagent that binds to protein and produces a color; by measuring the absorbance at the wavelength where the color appears, one can estimate the extent of binding between the reagent and the protein. This approach is referred to as the colorimetric method for protein quantification.

The following tests are included in the colorimetric methods:

- Amino Acid analysis
- UV absorption
- Biuret reaction
- Lowry reaction
- Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) test

Each test differs in sensitivity, required time, and resistance to interfering substances. The table below summarizes the key characteristics of each reagent.

| Test                         | Wavelength (nm) | Mechanism                                      | Advantages                                      | Standard Range         |
|------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Amino Acid analysis          | 570             | Protein hydrolysis, amino acid derivatization  | High sensitivity                                | 10–200 μg/mL           |
| UV absorption                | 280             | Tyrosine/tryptophan absorption                  | Short test duration, low sample volume          | 0.2–2 mg/mL            |
|                              | 205             | Peptide bond region                             | High potential for non-protein absorption       | 0.2–2 mg/mL            |
| Biuret                       | 540–560         | Copper reduction (Cu²⁺ → Cu¹⁺)                   | High detergent resistance, low sensitivity      | 0.5–10 mg/mL           |
| Lowry                        | 500–750         | Copper reduction, Folin reagent reaction         | High sensitivity, low resistance to interfering substances | 5–100 μg/mL   |
| Bicinchoninic acid (BCA)     | 562             | Copper reduction, BCA reaction                   | High resistance to detergents and denaturing agents, low resistance to reducing agents | 10–1200 μg/mL |
| Bradford                     | 470             | Coomassie Brilliant Blue complex formation       | Short test duration, high resistance to reducing agents, low detergent resistance | 0.1–1 mg/mL  |

The reagent and standard solution are placed in the spectrophotometer, and absorbance is measured at the reagent's maximum wavelength. A linear graph is plotted based on the reagent concentration versus absorbance, and a linear equation is used to estimate the protein concentration in the sample. The Biuret, Ninhydrin, Lowry, and Bradford reactions were all performed using egg white as the standard.

# 2. Experimental Methods

The experimental procedures conducted in this study are described as follows.

## 2.1 Protein Detection Experiments

Before the experiments, a muddy water sample was prepared to minimize the impact of soil particles on absorbance. After sample preparation, the following experiments were conducted:

- **Biuret Reaction**  
  A 1% CuSO₄ solution and a 5% NaOH solution were prepared, and egg white was isolated to create standard egg white solutions at concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2%, …, 1%. Each solution was pipetted into cuvettes, and absorbance was measured at 540 nm and 560 nm.

- **Lowry Reaction**  
  Na₂CO₃, NaOH, and CuSO₄·5H₂O solutions were prepared to create Lowry reagent A. This reagent was then reacted with Folin Ciocalteu reagent, and absorbance was measured at 620 nm and 750 nm.

- **Ninhydrin Reaction**  
  A 2% ninhydrin solution was prepared by dissolving 0.2 g of ninhydrin in 10 mL of ethanol (or acetone). The egg white standard and trypsin solution were then used to measure absorbance at 570 nm and 440 nm.

- **Bradford Reaction**  
  A reagent solution was prepared using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm and 465 nm.

## 2.2 UV-VIS Spectral Scanning

- **Using Distilled Water as Solvent**  
  Paper filters, 0.45 μm syringe filters, and 0.2 μm syringe filters were used sequentially to measure absorbance from 300 nm to 700 nm (or an extended range from 200 nm to 1000 nm) at 5 nm intervals. The data were analyzed using either an exponential fit or peak fitting.

- **Using Ethanol as Solvent**  
  The same experimental procedure was repeated for components soluble in ethanol.

## 3.3 Ninhydrin Reaction Results

The Ninhydrin reaction was carried out over several rounds. Results for the first, second, third, and fourth experiments, as well as corresponding soil sample results, are summarized in Tables 16 through 21.

For example:
- **Table 16:** Ninhydrin Reaction 1 Results (egg white, measurements at 570 nm and 440 nm)
- **Table 17:** Ninhydrin Reaction 1 Soil Sample Results
- **Table 18:** Ninhydrin Reaction 2 Results (including a positive control)
- **Table 19:** Ninhydrin Reaction 2 Soil Sample Results
- **Table 20:** Ninhydrin Reaction 3 Results
- **Table 21:** Ninhydrin Reaction 4 Soil Sample Results

Fitting results using Origin 2025 and the data trends for each experiment are shown in Figures 7 through 10, noting that the first experiment did not exhibit a clear linear pattern due to nearly random data.

## 3.4 Bradford Reaction Results

The Bradford reaction was performed using an egg white standard (0.01%–0.04%). Absorbance was measured at 595 nm and 465 nm, with the results summarized in Tables 24 and 25, respectively.

Linear fitting using Origin 2025 produced results for both 595 nm (Table 26) and 465 nm (Table 27). For 465 nm, a low adjusted R-square value suggested that background absorbance was a contributing factor.

The calculated protein percentages are summarized in Table 28:

| Sample   | Protein Percentage (%) |
|----------|------------------------|
| Sample 1 | 0.002                  |
| Sample 2 | 0.004                  |
| Sample 3 | 0.004                  |
| Sample 4 | 0.006                  |

## 3.5 Protein Detection – UV-VIS Spectral Scanning

### Using Distilled Water as the Solvent

- **Paper Filter:**  
  Absorbance was measured from 300 nm to 700 nm at 5 nm intervals. Exponential fitting parameters (a, b, c) were determined with an adjusted R-square of 0.99953 (see Table 29).
- **0.45 μm Syringe Filter:**  
  A peak was observed around 340 nm (see Figure 14).
- **0.2 μm Syringe Filter:**  
  A clear peak at 340 nm was observed (see Figure 15).

Additional experiments conducted after one day and one week provided peak analyses for Soil Samples 1 through 4 (with peaks ranging from 209 nm to 285 nm), detailed in Figures 16 through 22 and corresponding tables.

### Using Ethanol as the Solvent

- The same procedures were repeated using ethanol as the solvent, with similar measurements using paper and syringe filters (0.45 μm and 0.2 μm), and the results are presented similarly.

# 4. Conclusion

After heat treatment, the introduction of hydrogenation allowed the formation of an n-region using hydrogenation alone. SIMS distribution measurements confirmed that hydrogen filled vacancies in mercury, converting the residual impurity characteristics to n-type by forming an acceptor in the p-type substrate. Additionally, the reduction in the junction area due to hydrogen diffusion and the increased hole concentration along the CdTe substrate reduced the diffusion current and increased the resistance (Ro) in LWIR devices.

The signal acquisition circuit was verified using a 20×4 TDI signal acquisition circuit, and the new CMDI ROIC design technology demonstrated that a ROIC with an injection efficiency of 1 is achievable even for LWIR devices with low Ro.
